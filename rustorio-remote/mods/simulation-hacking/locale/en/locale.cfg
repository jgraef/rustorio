janosch-sh=Simulation Hacking

[mod-description]
janosch-sh=What if the *Engineer* could research advanced technology that not only allows him to prove that he lives in a simulation, it also allows him to hack into the simulation and uses it's computational resources to get more iron. This mod exposes the circuit network as a REST service.
